//! Named pipes (`CreateNamedPipeW`/`ConnectNamedPipeW`/`WaitNamedPipeW`) —
//! the Windows analog of a Unix named FIFO, or the `/dev/fd`-style
//! externally openable pipe a `coproc`/process-substitution
//! implementation needs. [`crate::handle::create_pipe`]'s anonymous pipes
//! only solve the "handed directly to a child this process itself spawns"
//! case: neither end has a name an arbitrary already-running program can
//! open. rush's own `docs/WINDOWS_JOB_CONTROL.md` ("Deliberately out of
//! scope") and `docs/CAPABILITY_GAPS.md` (C31 process substitution, C66
//! `coproc`) both name a named pipe as the missing primitive for `<(cmd)`/
//! `coproc` on Windows.
//!
//! A caller reads/writes a connected pipe handle exactly like any other
//! handle — wrap it in `std::fs::File`/`OwnedHandle` under the `std`
//! feature, or use [`crate::console::read`] (a plain `ReadFile` wrapper
//! despite its module) under `no_std`. This module only covers creating
//! the server end and connecting/opening the client end, not I/O — the
//! same split [`crate::handle::create_pipe`] already draws for anonymous
//! pipes.
//!
//! No `OVERLAPPED` support: [`connect_server`] blocks synchronously,
//! matching this crate's existing no-overlapped-I/O convention
//! (`handle`'s anonymous pipes, `console::read`).
