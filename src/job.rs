//! Windows Job Objects — the primitive rush's own
//! `docs/WINDOWS_JOB_CONTROL.md` designs background-job tracking against
//! (`&`, `jobs`, `wait`, `kill`, `$!`). A Job Object groups processes for
//! lifetime management, the closest Windows analog of a POSIX process group
//! for this purpose (not a perfect match — see that design doc's
//! "Terminology" note). Assigning a suspended process (see
//! [`crate::process::spawn_suspended`]) to a job *before* resuming its main
//! thread, with [`set_kill_on_close`] applied, means closing the job handle
//! (e.g. on shell exit) kills every process in it — the Windows analog of
//! the process-group-wide cleanup rush's Unix `job.rs` gets from signals.
//! Any child the job's own member processes spawn inherits job membership
//! automatically (a job property, not something a child opts into), which
//! is what makes this correct for a whole subtree, not just one process.
//!
//! [`create_completion_port`]/[`associate_completion_port`]/
//! [`wait_for_message`] close a real gap in the above: [`process_ids`] is
//! only ever a poll, never a push — there is no Unix-`SIGCHLD` equivalent
//! for "a job member just exited" without them. Associating a job with an
//! I/O completion port (a mechanism otherwise entirely about file I/O, not
//! process lifecycle — Windows repurposes it here rather than defining a
//! job-specific notification primitive) makes the OS itself post a message
//! every time a member process is created, exits, or the job empties out,
//! which [`wait_for_message`] blocks for. As with every other primitive in
//! this crate, deciding what a caller does with a given [`JOB_OBJECT_MSG_EXIT_PROCESS`]
//! (etc.) is the caller's policy — this module only delivers the raw message.
//!
//! [`set_resource_limits`]/[`limits`]/[`accounting`] round out the round-2
//! capability assessment's Job-Object-related item: `rush`'s `ulimit` is a
//! flat "not supported" on Windows today, and Job-Object memory/CPU-time/
//! active-process limits are that doc's own answer for the only realistic
//! partial fix — the struct fields these use
//! (`JobObjectExtendedLimitInformation`'s memory/CPU-time/process-count
//! fields) were already modeled bit-for-bit for [`set_kill_on_close`], just
//! never set beyond its one `LimitFlags` bit until now. [`accounting`]
//! (`JobObjectBasicAndIoAccountingInformation`) is Windows' real analog of
//! POSIX `cutime`/`cstime`: CPU time aggregated across every process a job
//! has *ever* contained, including ones already exited — unlike
//! [`crate::process::times`], which only ever reports one still-open
//! process handle's own times.
