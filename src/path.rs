//! `SearchPathW` — Windows' `PATH`-search primitive, and (looped over each

//! question with a `stat` mode-bit check; Windows has no executable bit at
//! all — a file is runnable purely by extension and registration, and
//! `PATHEXT` (`.COM;.EXE;.BAT;.CMD;...`) is the documented list of
//! extensions a bare command name (`foo`, not `foo.exe`) is tried against,
