//! `DuplicateHandle`/`CreatePipe`/`SetHandleInformation`/`CloseHandle` — the
//! Windows counterpart of Unix `dup`/`pipe2`/`close`, and the primitive rush
//! needs to close its fd-3-and-up gap (see rush's
//! `docs/WINDOWS_BACKEND_ANALYSIS.md` §4.2). Windows has no kernel-level
//! small-integer fd table the way Unix does — only the three std-handle
//! slots [`get_std_handle`]/[`set_std_handle`] read and swap, which this
//! crate's [`crate::console`] sibling doesn't otherwise touch. This module

//!
//! A Windows `HANDLE` is non-inheritable by default — the inverse of Unix's

//! unless explicitly marked `FD_CLOEXEC`. [`set_inheritable`] is the
//! `SetHandleInformation`/`HANDLE_FLAG_INHERIT` call that flips a specific
