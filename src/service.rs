//! Windows service control — `winsvc.h`, a new module added in round 2,
//! previously excluded by `ARCHITECTURE.md`'s non-goals (see
//! `gap-analysis.md`'s "Round 2: previously out-of-scope subsystems"
//! sweep), now in scope per explicit round-2 direction.
//!
//! Scope: a `systemctl`-equivalent — list/query/start/stop a named
//! service. Installing/removing services (`CreateServiceW`/
//! `DeleteService`), driver services, and service-controller-side
//! (writing a service's own `main`) support are all explicitly out of
//! scope.
//!
//! This first piece is the SCM/service handle lifecycle. An `SC_HANDLE`
//! is reused as this crate's existing [`crate::handle::RawHandle`]
//! (`*mut c_void`) rather than a distinct type — it's ABI-compatible
//! (`DECLARE_HANDLE`-based, exactly like `HANDLE` itself), and every
//! function in this module accepts/returns it, so a separate wrapper
//! type would add nothing; its destructor is `CloseServiceHandle`,
//! never `CloseHandle`, so it must never be passed to
//! [`crate::handle`]'s own close functions.
